    "- Values, and different data structures (especially `int`, `float`, and `str`)\n",
    "- Assigning values to variables with `=`\n",
    "- Comparing values with a number of *comparison operators*\n",
    "    - `==`\n",
    "    - `!=`\n",
    "    - `<`, `<=`\n",
    "    - `>`, `>=`\n",
    "- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to choose which path to take in our program\n",
    "    - Use an indented block to indicate what code should run\n",
    "    - We can use `and` and `or` to combine conditions into one larger one\n",
    "- Numbers (`int` and `float`)\n",
    "    - We can turn another value into an `int` by invoking `int` on it\n",
    "    - We can turn another value into a `float` by invoking `float` on it\n",
    "    - Floats and integers can work together just fine\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    "    - Creating strings with quotes of various sorts\n",
    "    - f-strings, which let us interpolate values into our strings\n",
    "    - Using `[]` to retrieve values from a string\n",
    "        - We can use a single integer to get one character\n",
    "        - We can use `[start:stop]` to get a *slice* from our string\n",
    "    - We can retrieve from the end of a string with negative indexes, starting from -1\n",
    "- Methods\n",
    "    - Methods are functions that are connected to an object; their name always has a `.` before it\n",
    "    - We can use `str.strip()` to remove any whitespace that might be on a string\n",
    "    - We can use `str.isdigit()` to check if a string only contains digits 0-9, and thus can be turned into an `int` without errors"
